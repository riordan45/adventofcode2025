[Advent Calendar 2025](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riordan45/adventofcode2025/blob/main/advent_calendar.html)

My solutions for Advent of Code 2025.

I am too lazy to make a proper folder structure.

Used Claude to help write part 2 of day 2, 9 and 10. Didn't care enough to look up how to properly use linear algebra solvers. At most I needed the linalg parts of numpy, tensorflow etc. in the past.
For Day 9, i did figure out the idea of checking if segments intersect, but again, too lazy to write it.

DP was on day 3, 7, 11.

Union Find was on day 8.

Also day 12 was such a troll, initially I thought I had to code up the algo used in Resident Evil 4 to arrange the attache case but nooooo
